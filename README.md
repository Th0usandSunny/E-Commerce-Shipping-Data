The analysis results have shown a consistent pattern in the data, where the "Reached on time" values with a label of 0 have a lower level compared to the label 1. This forms the basis for building a model that can provide accurate predictions. However, there are some limitations in the features that may affect the model's prediction quality for new data. We hope that the weaknesses in the model can be effectively addressed, especially in improving the recall value, which is crucial in our efforts to enhance our services and customer relations. This is because in the delivery business, customer trust is essential, and the quality of our service relies on our ability to provide accurate and timely predictions.
